## Data Processing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


> Start by reading in the desired data

```{r}
census_county <-
  read.csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01a.csv")
```

> Select the specific data in question, i.e. "Area Name", STCOU, and variables ending in "D". The "ends_with()" function, which is part of the {tidyselect} package can be used within the select function to identify those columns which end in "D".

```{r}
census_county |>
  select(Area_name, STCOU, ends_with("D"))
```


## Write a Generic Function for Summarizing



```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

## Put it Together
